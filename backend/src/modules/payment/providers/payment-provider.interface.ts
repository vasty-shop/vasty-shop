/**
 * Common interface that every payment provider implements.
 *
 * Pick a provider (or multiple) by setting PAYMENT_PROVIDER in your
 * .env to one of:
 *
 *   stripe         - Stripe (https://stripe.com). Global card processing
 *                    + Stripe Connect for marketplace vendor splits.
 *                    The production default.
 *
 *   paypal         - PayPal (https://paypal.com). Global alternative
 *                    with wide consumer reach.
 *
 *   bkash          - bKash (https://bkash.com). Bangladesh's largest
 *                    mobile money wallet. Required for any
 *                    Bangladesh-facing marketplace.
 *
 *   none           - Payments disabled. Every method throws.
 *                    The default if PAYMENT_PROVIDER is unset.
 *
 * Planned follow-ups (tracked in issue #18):
 *   razorpay, paystack, mollie, mpesa, square, adyen, lemonsqueezy,
 *   sslcommerz, nagad
 *
 * Why some planned providers aren't in this first-pass PR:
 *  - razorpay / paystack / mollie: each need a separate OAuth-like
 *    vendor-onboarding flow (Route / Subaccount / Connect) before
 *    marketplace splits work. Follow-up PRs per-region.
 *  - square / adyen: enterprise-scale with complex onboarding.
 *  - mpesa: Safaricom Daraja API needs a TLS client cert exchange
 *    that doesn't fit a pure-fetch adapter.
 *  - sslcommerz / nagad: Bangladesh-specific, similar surface to
 *    bkash but with different quirks — sensible to add after bkash
 *    is proven in production.
 *  - lemonsqueezy: digital-goods merchant-of-record, different
 *    refund/tax semantics that deserve their own module.
 *
 * Shipping 3 real providers in this PR is deliberate: they cover
 * the US/EU card path (stripe + paypal) AND the Bangladesh mobile
 * wallet path (bkash) which together handle ~80% of vasty-shop's
 * target audience. The rest land as follow-up PRs with their own
 * verification + marketplace-split logic.
